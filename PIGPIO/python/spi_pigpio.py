mm defines the SPI mode.

WARNING: modes 1 and 3 do not appear to work on the auxiliary device.

Mode POL PHA
 0    0   0
 1    0   1
 2    1   0
 3    1   1


px is 0 if CEx is active low (default) and 1 for active high.

ux is 0 if the CEx GPIO is reserved for SPI (default) and 1 otherwise.

A is 0 for the standard SPI device, 1 for the auxiliary SPI.

W is 0 if the device is not 3-wire, 1 if the device is 3-wire. Standard SPI device only.

nnnn defines the number of bytes (0-15) to write before switching the MOSI line to MISO to read data. This field is ignored if W is not set. Standard SPI device only.

T is 1 if the least significant bit is transmitted on MOSI first, the default (0) shifts the most significant bit out first. Auxiliary SPI device only.

R is 1 if the least significant bit is received on MISO first, the default (0) receives the 
most significant bit first. Auxiliary SPI device only.

bbbbbb defines the word size in bits (0-32). The default (0) sets 8 bits per word. Auxiliary SPI device only.
