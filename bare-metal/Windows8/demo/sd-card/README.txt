Ultibo Core Demo
----------------

 This is a self running demo image for Ultibo core.
 
 To install the demo simply copy the contents of this zip file to the root directory
 of an SD card.

 Connect a monitor to the HDMI output of your Raspberry Pi (all models are supported),
 if you have a network connection available (models B/B+/2B/3B) you can connect a network
 cable which will enable additional features in the demo. A USB keyboard can also be 
 connected if available to enable the option to rerun the demo when completed.

 Insert the SD card and power on your Raspberry Pi. About 2 or 3 seconds after powering
 on you should see output on the monitor, if you don't, check the SD card is inserted 
 correctly and the power is connected.

 The demo runs for about 3 minutes and explores some of the features available in Ultibo
 core. Once completed you can follow the information on screen to explore more of what
 is available.


 Thanks, the Ultibo team.
