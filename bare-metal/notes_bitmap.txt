This is a simple example that your can copy and paste into a new project in 
Lazarus, it is written for a Raspberry Pi 2B but you can easily change it 
to a 3B by replacing the RaspberryPi2 in the uses clause with 
RaspberryPi3 and if you want to make it work with Raspberry 
Pi A/B/A+/B+/Zero then just replace RaspberryPi2 in the uses clause 
with RaspberryPi instead.

Most likely you'll want to use this in your own projects so we've made 
drawing the bitmap its own function, just copy the DrawBitmap() 
function into a unit of your project and make sure you have the 
GraphicsConsole, BMPcomn, Classes and SysUtils units in the uses clause.
